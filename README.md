About the Game

A snake game featuring classic mechanics with added power-ups, dynamic food interactions, and a competitive co-op mode for two players.

Features Implemented

1.Movement

  The snake can move in all four directions (up, down, left, and right) using standard controls.

2.Screen Wrapping

  When the snake crosses the boundaries of the screen, it reappears on the opposite side seamlessly.

3.Self-Collision

  If the snake bites its own body, it dies and the game ends.

4.Growth Mechanic

  Eating mass-gainer food increases the snake's length, making it harder to navigate.

5.Power-Ups

  Shield: Temporarily prevents the snake from dying even if it collides with its own body.
  Score Boost: Doubles the points gained from eating mass-gainer food for a limited time.
  Speed Up: Increases the snake's movement speed, making the game more challenging.
  Each power-up has a cooldown period of 3 seconds, which can be adjusted for flexibility.
  Power-ups spawn randomly at unpredictable intervals on the game screen.

6.Food Mechanics

  Mass Gainer Food: Increases the snake's length and adds points to the score.
  Mass Burner Food: Reduces the snake's length but does not spawn if the snake is already too short.
  Food items automatically disappear after a set time if not consumed.
  Both types of food spawn at random intervals to keep the gameplay dynamic.

7.Co-Op Mode

  A two-player mode where Player 1 controls their snake using the WASD keys, and Player 2 uses the arrow keys.
  If one snake collides with the other, the bitten snake dies, adding a competitive element to the game.
  Scoring System
  Consuming mass-gainer food increases the player's score, while mass-burner food reduces it.

8.User Interface (UI)
  Basic UI includes screens for death, win, and the main lobby.
  Functional buttons for pausing, resuming, restarting, and quitting the game are available.
